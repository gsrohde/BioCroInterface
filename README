To use this test suite in a BioCro source tree:

1. Install GoogleTest version 1.13.0 or later if you haven't installed
   it already.  On macOS, it may be installed with Homebrew by running

   brew install googletest

2. Clone this repository as a subdirectory of the root directory of
   a BioCro source tree:

   cd <root of a BioCro package source tree>
   git clone git@github.com:gsrohde/BioCroInterface.git

3. CD to the repository root and initialize and recursively update its
   submodule:

   cd BioCroInterface
   git submodule update --init --recursive

4. Compile the testBML module library by installing the R pacakge:

   cd testBML
   R CMD INSTALL .

[To-Do: Add a Make file to the testBML src directory that will make
testBML.so without installing the corresponding R package.]

5. Make the tests and run them:

   cd ..
   make


The command *make* will both compile the tests and then run them.
Once the tests are compiled, you can also run them directly with the
command

   ./test_all

This allows for the use of various GoogleTest test-running options.
For example,

   ./test_all --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests

will run the tests that are currently disabled (and that will
currently fail).

The Make file also contains targets for building individual test
files, as well as convenience numeric targets for building and then
running tests.  Inspect the Make file for details.
